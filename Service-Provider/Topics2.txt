Study Guide for Routing Protocols and High Availability
2.1 Implement IS-IS (IPv4 and IPv6)

    2.1.a Route Advertisement:
        IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) is a link-state routing protocol used to exchange routing information between routers.
        IS-IS advertises routes to its neighbors using LSPs (Link State PDU), which contain the routing information about the router's interface and its neighbors.

    2.1.b Area Addressing:
        IS-IS uses areas to organize the network into smaller, more manageable sections.
        Level 1 routers communicate within their own area, while Level 2 routers connect different areas.
        IS-IS supports IPv4 and IPv6 addressing within each area.

    2.1.c Multitopology:
        Multitopology in IS-IS allows for the configuration of multiple logical topologies to be run over a single network infrastructure.
        This allows flexibility for different types of traffic, such as MPLS, and non-MPLS traffic, to be routed differently.

    2.1.d Metrics:
        IS-IS uses metrics to determine the best path. The metric is a value assigned to the link to reflect its cost.
        The default metric is "1", but it can be modified to reflect bandwidth, delay, or other parameters.

2.2 Implement OSPF (v2 and v3)

    2.2.a Neighbor Adjacency:
        OSPF routers form adjacencies with their directly connected neighbors.
        Adjacency formation involves a series of steps: exchanging Hello packets, forming a DBD (Database Description), exchanging LSR (Link State Request), LSU (Link State Update), and finally LSA (Link State Acknowledgement).

    2.2.b Route Advertisement:
        OSPF advertises LSAs (Link State Advertisements) to share routing information.
        OSPFv2 uses IPv4, and OSPFv3 supports IPv6.
        The LSA types (Type 1-5) define the types of network information shared.

    2.2.c Multiarea (Addressing and Types):
        OSPF Multiarea networks use a hierarchical design with a backbone area (Area 0) and additional areas.
        Routers in different areas must have a connection to Area 0, which ensures proper inter-area routing.
        Types of areas include:
            Standard Area: Regular OSPF area.
            Stub Area: An area that doesn't receive external routes.
            Totally Stubby Area: Blocks both external and inter-area routes.
            Not-so-stubby Area (NSSA): Can receive external routes but cannot advertise them.

    2.2.d Metrics:
        OSPF uses the cost metric, which is based on the interface bandwidth.
        Cost is calculated as: cost = 100,000,000 / bandwidth.
        OSPF prefers the path with the lowest cost.

2.3 Describe BGP Path Selection Algorithm

    BGP Path Selection Algorithm:
        BGP uses several steps to select the best path, considering various factors:
            Weight: The local preference of the path (Cisco-specific attribute).
            Local Preference: Prefer the path with the highest local preference (for IBGP).
            AS Path Length: Prefer the path with the shortest AS path (avoiding longer, indirect routes).
            Origin Type: Prefer IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) over EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol) and Incomplete (unknown origin).
            MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator): Prefer the path with the lowest MED value.
            EBGP over IBGP: Prefer EBGP-learned routes over IBGP-learned routes.
            IGP Metric: Prefer the path with the lowest IGP metric to the BGP next-hop.
            Oldest Route: Prefer the oldest route in case of a tie.
            BGP Router ID: As a last tie-breaker, prefer the route from the router with the lowest BGP router ID.

2.4 Implement BGP (v4 and v6 for IBGP and EBGP)

    2.4.a Neighbors:
        IBGP (Internal BGP): BGP peers within the same Autonomous System.
        EBGP (External BGP): BGP peers between different Autonomous Systems.
        Neighbor configuration involves specifying the IP address and AS number of the remote peer.

    2.4.b Prefix Advertisement:
        BGP advertises network prefixes (routes) using Network Command or Redistribution from other routing protocols.
        BGP routes are advertised with NEXT_HOP attributes that point to the next-hop IP address.

    2.4.c Address Family:
        BGP can advertise different address families:
            IPv4 Unicast
            IPv6 Unicast
            VPNv4 / VPNv6 (for MPLS VPNs)
        Configuration of BGP Address Families allows BGP to support both IPv4 and IPv6 routing simultaneously.

    2.4.d Path Selection:
        BGP's path selection is based on various attributes such as AS Path, MED, and Local Preference (as described in section 2.3).

    2.4.e Attributes:
        Key attributes in BGP include:
            AS Path
            Next Hop
            MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator)
            Local Preference
            Origin
            Community: Used for tagging and controlling routing policies.

    2.4.f Redistribution:
        Redistributing routes between different routing protocols (e.g., OSPF to BGP, or IS-IS to BGP).
        You must define the metrics and possibly manipulate attributes during redistribution.

    2.4.g Additional Paths:
        BGP supports Additional Paths to advertise multiple paths for the same prefix, allowing better load balancing and fault tolerance.

    2.4.h PIC (Prefix Independent Convergence):
        Prefix Independent Convergence (PIC) ensures that the BGP routing table can converge quickly even after a failure, reducing downtime and network instability.

2.5 Implement Routing Policy Language and Route Maps (BGP, OSPF, IS-IS)

    Routing Policy Language:
        Route Maps: Used to control the redistribution of routes and the application of routing policies.
        Can match criteria based on various attributes (e.g., IP prefixes, BGP AS Path) and set new attributes (e.g., local preference, metric).

    Use of Route Maps in BGP, OSPF, and IS-IS:
        For BGP, route maps are often used for filtering prefixes, modifying attributes, and controlling route redistribution.
        For OSPF, route maps can control the redistribution of routes between OSPF and other protocols.
        For IS-IS, route maps can modify the behavior of route redistribution between IS-IS and other protocols.

2.6 Troubleshoot Routing Protocols

    2.6.a Neighbor Adjacency (IS-IS, OSPF, BGP):
        IS-IS: Use commands like show isis neighbor to check the status of adjacencies.
        OSPF: Use show ip ospf neighbor to check OSPF neighbor relationships.
        BGP: Use show ip bgp summary to see the status of BGP peer connections.

    2.6.b Route Advertisement (IS-IS, OSPF, BGP):
        IS-IS: Use show isis database to verify the advertised routes.
        OSPF: Use show ip ospf database to view the LSAs.
        BGP: Use show ip bgp to check the BGP route table and verify advertisements.

2.7 Describe IPv6 Transition (NAT44, NAT64, CGNAT, MAP-T, and DS Lite)

    NAT44:
        IPv4-to-IPv4 Network Address Translation.
        Used for mapping private IPv4 addresses to public IPv4 addresses.

    NAT64:
        Provides communication between IPv6 and IPv4 networks by translating IPv6 packets into IPv4 packets.

    CGNAT (Carrier-Grade NAT):
        Used by ISPs to conserve IPv4 addresses by translating multiple customer private IPs to a single public IPv4 address.

    MAP-T (Mapping of Address and Port - Translation):
        Translates IPv6 packets into IPv4 packets with both address and port mapping.

    DS Lite (Dual-Stack Lite):
        Provides IPv6 connectivity to IPv4-only applications by tunneling IPv4 packets over an IPv6 network.

2.8 Implement High Availability

    2.8.a NSF / Graceful Restart:
        NSF (Non-Stop Forwarding) allows routers to continue forwarding traffic while the routing protocol is reconverging.
        Graceful Restart enables routers to maintain their forwarding state during the restart process.

    2.8.b NSR (Non-Stop Routing):
        Ensures the routerâ€™s control plane remains operational during a failure, providing continuous routing without dropping packets.

    2.8.c BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection):
        A protocol that quickly detects faults in the path between two forwarding devices, improving network convergence times.

    2.8.d Link Aggregation:
        EtherChannel or Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) combines multiple physical links into a single logical link for improved redundancy and bandwidth.
