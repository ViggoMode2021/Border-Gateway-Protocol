Study Guide for VPN Services, L2VPN, L3VPN, Multicast, and QoS
4.1 Describe VPN Services

    4.1.a EVPN (Ethernet VPN):
        EVPN is a Layer 2 VPN technology that uses BGP to provide Ethernet-based services over MPLS or IP networks.
        It enables multi-tenant networks with flexible and scalable connectivity, supporting both unicast and multicast traffic.
        Key features:
            MAC learning and distribution.
            Multi-homing and redundancy.
            Active-active redundancy.

    4.1.b Inter-AS VPN:
        Inter-AS VPN refers to connecting VPNs that span across multiple Autonomous Systems (AS).
        This involves using BGP to exchange VPN routes between different ASes while maintaining separation between provider networks.
        It can be implemented in two ways:
            Option A: Uses multiple VPNv4 BGP sessions to connect ASes.
            Option B: Utilizes MPLS to forward traffic between ASes, simplifying routing.

    4.1.c CSC (Customer-Specific Connection):
        CSC is typically a model where service providers offer tailored VPN services to meet specific customer needs.
        It focuses on providing connectivity to customer networks while maintaining isolation and security within the VPN.

    4.1.d mVPN (Multicast VPN):
        mVPN is used to extend multicast services across an MPLS network.
        It allows for the delivery of multicast traffic over a service provider's infrastructure, providing support for applications such as video conferencing or IPTV.
        It typically involves the use of PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast) in combination with MPLS to ensure efficient multicast distribution.

4.2 Configure L2VPN and Carrier Ethernet

    4.2.a Ethernet Services (E-Line, E-Tree, E-Access, E-LAN):
        E-Line: A point-to-point Ethernet service that provides a dedicated link between two locations.
        E-Tree: A point-to-multipoint Ethernet service where a central node is connected to multiple leaf nodes, typically used in business services.
        E-Access: A simplified access model to connect enterprise customers to a service provider’s Ethernet network.
        E-LAN: A multipoint-to-multipoint Ethernet service allowing multiple sites to communicate as if they were on the same local area network (LAN).

    4.2.b IEEE 802.1ad, IEEE 802.1ah, and ITU G.8032:
        IEEE 802.1ad (Q-in-Q): A standard for adding an additional Ethernet tag to a frame, allowing service providers to manage customer traffic with two VLAN tags.
        IEEE 802.1ah (Provider Backbone Bridging): A standard for scaling Ethernet services over wide-area networks (WAN), using backbone VLANs.
        ITU G.8032: A standard for Ethernet ring protection, enabling rapid failover and fault tolerance in Ethernet networks.

    4.2.c Ethernet OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance):
        Ethernet OAM provides monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities for Ethernet services.
        Includes tools like Loopback, Link Trace, and Remote Fault Detection to diagnose and resolve network issues in Ethernet-based services.

    4.2.d VLAN Tag Manipulation:
        VLAN Tag Manipulation refers to the process of adding, removing, or modifying VLAN tags in Ethernet frames.
        Commonly used in services such as Q-in-Q, where outer tags represent the service provider’s network and inner tags are used for customer networks.

4.3 Configure L3VPN

    4.3.a Intra-AS VPN:
        Intra-AS VPN involves providing VPN services within a single AS, typically using MPLS.
        The service is configured using BGP for route exchange and MPLS LSPs for forwarding.

    4.3.b Shared Services (Extranet and Internet):
        Extranet: A network that allows controlled access from outside an organization’s private network, often implemented using VPNs for secure remote access.
        Internet: VPNs can provide secure access to the internet by encrypting traffic between remote users and the service provider’s infrastructure.

4.4 Implement Multicast Services

    4.4.a PIM (PIM-SM, PIM-SSM, and PIM-BIDIR):
        PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast) is used for routing multicast traffic in IP networks.
            PIM-SM (Sparse Mode): Multicast traffic is forwarded only when there is interest in a particular group.
            PIM-SSM (Source-Specific Multicast): Simplifies multicast by sending traffic only to receivers that have explicitly subscribed to a specific source.
            PIM-BIDIR (Bidirectional): Allows multicast traffic to be sent from any source to multiple receivers within a bidirectional distribution tree.

    4.4.b IGMP v1/v2/v3 and MLD:
        IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol): Used for managing multicast group memberships in IPv4 networks.
            IGMP v1: Basic version, with only support for joining and leaving groups.
            IGMP v2: Adds support for group-specific queries.
            IGMP v3: Supports source-specific multicast.
        MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery): The IPv6 equivalent of IGMP, used to manage multicast group memberships in IPv6 networks.

4.5 Implement QoS Services

    4.5.a Classification and Marking:
        Classification: Categorizing network traffic into classes based on defined criteria (e.g., IP address, port number).
        Marking: Assigning a specific value (such as DSCP or IP precedence) to the traffic to indicate its priority or type of service.
    4.5.b Congestion Avoidance, Traffic Policing, and Shaping:
        Congestion Avoidance: Techniques to prevent congestion in the network, including Random Early Detection (RED).
        Traffic Policing: Controls the amount of traffic sent by the user by measuring packet rates and enforcing traffic limits.
        Traffic Shaping: Smoothens traffic flows by delaying packets to ensure they conform to a specific traffic profile or rate.
