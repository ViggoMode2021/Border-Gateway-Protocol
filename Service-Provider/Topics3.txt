Study Guide for MPLS, Traffic Engineering, and Segment Routing
3.1 Implement MPLS

    3.1.a LDP Sync:
        LDP Sync (Label Distribution Protocol Synchronization) ensures that the Label Switched Path (LSP) is synchronized with the IGP routing table.
        LDP synchronization allows the MPLS LSP to be established only after the IGP routes are stable and available.

    3.1.b LDP Session Protection:
        LDP Session Protection ensures that the LDP session between two routers remains active even if one of the links goes down temporarily.
        This feature helps maintain MPLS forwarding paths without disruption.

    3.1.c LDP Neighbors:
        LDP Neighbors are routers that have established LDP sessions with each other to exchange label bindings.
        LDP peers use Hello Protocol to discover each other and exchange labels for forwarding traffic.

    3.1.d Unified MPLS:
        Unified MPLS combines both MPLS LDP (Label Distribution Protocol) and MPLS TE (Traffic Engineering) into a single, cohesive framework.
        It allows for a unified control plane to manage both standard MPLS and traffic-engineered LSPs.

    3.1.e MPLS OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance):
        MPLS OAM tools are used to monitor and troubleshoot MPLS networks.
        Includes mechanisms like ping and trace route for MPLS LSPs, and more advanced functions such as LSP ping, LSP trace route, and MPLS LSP fault detection.

3.2 Describe Traffic Engineering

    3.2.a ISIS and OSPF Extensions:
        ISIS and OSPF Traffic Engineering Extensions add TE information into the IGP databases.
        These extensions enable the routers to compute the optimal paths for traffic using constraints like bandwidth, delay, and available resources.

    3.2.b RSVP Functionality:
        RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol) is used for signaling and reserving resources for traffic engineering in MPLS.
        It allows routers to signal for explicit paths and set up LSPs with guaranteed bandwidth, ensuring quality of service (QoS).

    3.2.c FRR (Fast Reroute):
        FRR enables quick recovery from link or node failures by pre-creating backup paths.
        FRR mechanisms allow MPLS traffic to quickly be rerouted to an alternate path in the event of a failure, minimizing downtime.

3.3 Describe Segment Routing

    3.3.a Segment Types:
        Segment Routing uses different types of segments, which represent a forwarding instruction.
        Types include:
            Node Segments: Point to a specific router.
            Adjacency Segments: Point to a specific link between two routers.
            Prefix Segments: Point to a destination prefix.
            Binding SID: Refers to an IGP prefix (can be used to steer traffic).

    3.3.b SR Control Plane (BGP, OSPF, IS-IS):
        Segment Routing (SR) Control Plane leverages existing IGP protocols (BGP, OSPF, IS-IS) for routing and label distribution.
        BGP can carry SR information for inter-domain routing, while OSPF and IS-IS distribute SR labels in their link-state databases.

    3.3.c Segment Routing Traffic Engineering:
        SR Traffic Engineering (SR-TE) enables the use of constraints, such as bandwidth, latency, and priority, to select paths based on traffic demands.
        SR-TE uses SR Policies that define path constraints and provides greater control over traffic distribution.

    3.3.d TI-LFa (Traffic Engineering with Local Fast Reroute):
        TI-LFa is a mechanism that provides fast reroute (FRR) by creating backup paths within the segment routing framework.
        It ensures traffic can be quickly rerouted if there is a failure in the network, using local protection techniques.

    3.3.e PCE-PCC Architectures:
        PCE (Path Computation Element) is a centralized system that calculates the optimal paths for traffic engineering.
        PCC (Path Computation Client) refers to the routers that request and use the computed paths from the PCE.
        This architecture allows for more complex path calculations and optimizations across the network.

    3.3.f Flexible Algorithm:
        Flexible Algorithms allow for greater customization and flexibility in traffic engineering path computation.
        Instead of relying on traditional IGP metrics, they allow the application of various constraints like latency, bandwidth, or resource availability to optimize routing decisions.

    3.3.g Locator, Micro-Segment, Encapsulation, Interworking Gateway:
        Locator: A unique identifier for a segment that helps forward packets in Segment Routing.
        Micro-Segment: A smaller unit of the network that can be used in Segment Routing to provide granular control of traffic flows.
        Encapsulation: SR uses encapsulation techniques such as MPLS or IPv6 headers to carry the segment list.
        Interworking Gateway: A device that enables communication between networks that use different protocols, such as traditional MPLS and Segment Routing.
