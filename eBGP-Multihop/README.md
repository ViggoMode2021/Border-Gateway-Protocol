** eBGP Multihop **

Overview: Allows admin to alter the TTL of BGP packets to form BGP neighbor relationships when two or more
routers are separated from a non-BGP speaking router. For example, BGP packets have a TTL of one, so the admin can 
increase the TTL to 2 if a non-BGP router separates two BGP-speaking routers.
